The project appears to be in an advanced state of completion with well-structured code, comprehensive tests, and Docker configuration. Based on my analysis, I estimate the following project status:

- Total estimated engineering hours for the project: 100 hours
- Hours completed by Blitzy: 80 hours (80%)
- Hours remaining for human developers: 20 hours (20%)
