# Security Policy

This document outlines the security procedures and policies for the Node.js Hello World HTTP server project.

## Security Scope

This project is a simple educational example with minimal security concerns. It is designed to demonstrate basic Node.js HTTP server functionality and is not intended for production use without additional security measures.

The application:
- Does not store or process sensitive data
- Does not require user authentication or authorization
- Does not implement user sessions or account management
- Does not connect to databases or external services
- Does not process or transmit personally identifiable information

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of this project receives security updates. As an educational tool, we recommend always using the most recent version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously, even though it is primarily an educational tool. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by the maintainers.
2. Submit a report by creating a new issue using the Bug Report template and prefix the title with [SECURITY].
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce if possible.
4. If applicable, include information about the potential impact of the vulnerability.

You can expect the following response process:

- Acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- Validation of the reported issue
- An estimated timeline for a fix, if applicable
- Notification when the issue is resolved

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure.

## Security Considerations

Although this is a minimal educational application, we implement the following basic security practices:

### Input Validation
- Validate HTTP method and path to prevent unexpected behavior from malformed requests
- Only accept GET requests to the `/hello` endpoint

### Error Handling
- Avoid exposing system details in error responses
- Implement consistent error handling for different error types

### HTTP Headers
- Set appropriate content-type headers to ensure proper content interpretation

### Logging
- Implement minimal logging without sensitive data
- Log server startup events, request processing, and errors for basic troubleshooting

## Security Recommendations for Production Use

If you intend to adapt this code for production use, consider implementing these additional security measures:

### Essential Security Enhancements

1. **HTTPS Implementation**
   - Use TLS/SSL for all communications
   - Obtain and configure proper SSL certificates
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

2. **Security Headers**
   - Implement Helmet.js or similar to add security headers
   - Set appropriate Content-Security-Policy
   - Enable X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add request throttling to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
   - Implement IP-based or token-based rate limiting

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement structured logging with appropriate levels
   - Set up monitoring for unusual traffic patterns
   - Establish alerting for potential security incidents

5. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep Node.js and all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly check for security advisories
   - Implement a process for applying security patches

## Dependency Management

This project intentionally minimizes external dependencies to reduce security risks. However, if you extend the project with additional dependencies, follow these guidelines:

1. Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions
2. Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
3. Consider using tools like Snyk or Dependabot for automated vulnerability detection
4. Review the security implications of each new dependency before adding it
